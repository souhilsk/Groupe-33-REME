# Impact of the Expulsion Initiative on Foreign Crime Rates in Switzerland

This repository contains the materials, data, and code for our empirical research project conducted as part of the course *Recherche Empirique en Economie et Management*.

## 📌 Research Question

**What is the impact of the implementation of the initiative on the expulsion of foreign criminals on the foreign crime rate in Switzerland?**

This project investigates whether the Swiss federal initiative—approved in 2010 and implemented in 2016—targeting the automatic expulsion of foreign nationals convicted of certain crimes has had a measurable effect on crime rates among foreign populations in Switzerland.
Link of the original initiative (2010) : https://www.bk.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/vi/vis357t.html
Link of the implementation intitiative (2016): https://www.bk.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/vi/vis433t.html

## 🧠 Methodology

Our research approach is based on causal inference in applied econometrics. We plan to use:
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** techniques
- Potential robustness checks using fixed effects panel models or synthetic controls

The analysis will be conducted entirely in **Stata**, using `.do` files to ensure reproducibility.

## 📊 Data Sources

We aim to gather data from:
- **Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO)** — crime statistics disaggregated by nationality
- Additional sources may include academic datasets or press briefings relevant to the initiative’s timeline

Details on variables, transformations, and cleaning will be available in the `data/` and `scripts/` folders.

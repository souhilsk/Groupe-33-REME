> **Shock and No Shift: Impact of the Expulsion Initiative on Foreign Crime Rates in Switzerland**  
> _The findings are data-driven and do not reflect any normative stance._

On October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2016, Switzerland’s “Pour le renvoi des étrangers criminels” initiative (expulsion of foreign criminals) took effect. Using canton-level data from 2010–2023, we implement a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework comparing violent‐crime rates among foreign residents vs. Swiss nationals. We find no statistically significant effect of the expulsion law on foreign‐resident violent crime.

Key contributions:

- First empirical evaluation of Switzerland’s 2016 expulsion law.  
- Panel data (26 cantons × 2 residency groups × 14 years = 728 cells).  
- Robustness checks: parallel‐trend tests, event-study, alternative transformations (Box–Cox, log, linear), placebo reforms, canton heterogeneity, wild-bootstrap inference.
